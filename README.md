   ## Background: 
     Analyze Citibike data

   ## Technologies used:
     * Pandas
     * Tableau 

   ## Steps taken:

     For this work, the dataset will be used from [New York Citi Bike data page](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)
     The specific citibike tripdata CSV used for this challenge is from year 01, 2019 (See jupyter notebook for more information about the data source).

    * In this challenge analysis of tripdata will take place:
      This challenge will have the following-
      * * 4 visualizations
      * * static map
      * * 2 dashboards
      * * one story
 
   * Because of loading issues, only the first 500 datapoints were taken from the csv file for analysis so no major conclusions can be drawn. But there are trends   that can be observed through the visualizations.
